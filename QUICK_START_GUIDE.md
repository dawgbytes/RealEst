## 🏠 WHERE TO FIND PROPERTIES (NO AUCTIONS)

### **Method 1: HUD Homes (BEST FOR ZERO REHAB)**
- **Website:** HUDHomestore.com
- **Filter:** "Insurable" status (means minimal repairs)
- **Why:** "Insurable" = move-in ready or basic repairs only
- **Avoid:** "Uninsurable" = major repairs needed

### **Method 2: Bank REO Departments**
- **Contact directly:** Call bank REO departments
- **Banks to call:**
  - Wells Fargo: 1-800-416-1472
  - Bank of America: 1-800-669-6607
  - Chase: 1-866-550-5705
  - Local banks in target areas
- **Why:** Off-market deals, quick closes, often move-in ready

### **Method 3: Wholesalers**
- **Atlanta:** MPG Deals (mpgdeals.com)
- **Nationwide:** QuickFlip Construction
- **Why:** Off-market deals, specify "no rehab needed"
- **Tip:** Build relationships for future deals

### **Method 4: Real Estate Agents**
- **Find:** Agents specializing in REO/foreclosures
- **Ask:** For "move-in ready" or "minimal rehab" properties
- **Why:** They have access to listings before public

### **Method 5: Pre-Foreclosure**
- **Source:** County records, public notices
- **Strategy:** Contact owners before foreclosure
- **Why:** Often well-maintained, motivated sellers

## 💰 PROFIT CALCULATION (Quick Formula)

```
Purchase Price: $60,000
Loan Amount (95% LTV): $57,000
Interest Reserve (6 months @ 12%): $3,420
Closing Costs: $3,000
Total Loan: $63,420

ARV: $110,000
Selling Costs (6% + closing): $8,600
Loan Payoff: $63,420
Net Profit: $37,980

For $40,000+ profit on $60k purchase:
Need ARV of $115,000+
```

**Rule of Thumb:** ARV must be at least **1.9x purchase price** to net $40k+ after all costs.
