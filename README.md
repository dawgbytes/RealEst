## 💰 Profit Calculation (Quick Formula)

```
Purchase Price: $60,000
Loan Amount (95% LTV): $57,000
Interest Reserve (6 months): $3,420
Closing Costs: $3,000
Total Loan: $63,420

ARV: $110,000
Selling Costs (6% + closing): $8,600
Loan Payoff: $63,420
Net Profit: $37,980

For $40,000+ profit on $60k purchase:
Need ARV of $115,000+
```

**Rule of Thumb:** ARV must be at least **1.9x purchase price** to net $40k+ after all costs.
